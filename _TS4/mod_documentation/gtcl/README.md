# GetTogether Club Limits for TS4
The mod removes various GT club limits.

It will not break with every TS4 update as it is script based. So there will be usually no new release after a TS4 update.

### Configuration
After startup the mod writes a new configuration template to `The Sims 4/mod_data/gt_club_limits/clubs.ini.current.ini`. This file can be copied to `clubs.ini` and modified to change the default settings.
There is no PIE menu to change the settings.

##### PIE menu options
PIE menu options to
* Join an existing or new clubs (*1)
* Delete existing clubs (*1)
* Become the leader of a club
* Invite multiple sims to a club (up to 100 per invitation, use this with care)
* Start a club gathering (While at work one can not join an active gathering.)
* Add 10,000 points to a club

(*1) With the UI not updating properly the active sim itself can not delete its own clubs or join a new one. Click on any other random sim for these interactions.
A new club is always named 'o19'. Switch to the sim who is the owner of the new club to configure it as usual (name, description, rules, ...).

##### Cheat Commands
For testing purposes cheats have been added, they affect the active sim.
* `GT_Club_Limits.help` - Print and log the following cheat commands:
* `o19.gtcl.join` - Join an existing club
* `o19.gtcl.delete` - Delete existing clubs (*1)
* `o19.gtcl.lead` - Become the leader of a club
* `o19.gtcl.invite` - Invite multiple sims to a club
* `o19.gtcl.start` - Start a club gathering
* `o19.gtcl.points` - Add 10,000 points to a club
* `o19.gtcl.print` - Write all club names and leaders to the log file

##### Maximum number of Sims that can be in a single Club.
As soons as Sim is in 3 Clubs it can not create a new Club, but it still can join Clubs or other household Sims can add it to a Club.

`MAX_MEMBERS_UNLIMITED:  True` can be set to `MAX_MEMBERS_UNLIMITED:  False` and then the `MAX_CLUB_MEMBERS` can be set. The default removes all limits.

##### Maximum number of Clubs a Sim can be a member of
The number of Clubs can be limited. Depending on the screen resolution and settings about 9 clubs can be displayed without a scroll-bar.

`MAX_CLUBS_UNLIMITED:  True` can be set to `MAX_CLUBS_UNLIMITED:  False` and then the `MAX_CLUBS` can be set. The default removes all limits.

##### Zones for Club gatherings
With `NO_CLUB_ZONE_VALIDATION:  True` all zones should be accepted to start a club gathering. This can be disabled with `NO_CLUB_ZONE_VALIDATION: False`.

##### Club Requirements
With `NO_CLUB_REQUIREMENTS_VALIDATION: True` everyone should be able to join the club. This can be disabled with `NO_CLUB_REQUIREMENTS_VALIDATION: False`. It may allow to add non-humans to clubs.

### Manual Installation
If you don't want to extract the ZIP file into `The Sims 4` folder you might want to read this. 
* The files in `ZIP-File/mod_data` are usually required and should be extracted to `The Sims 4/mod_data`.
* The files in `ZIP-File/mod_documentation` are for you to read it. They are not needed to use this mod.
* The `Mods/_o19_/*.ts4script` files can be stored in a random folder within `Mods` or directly in `Mods`. I highly recommend to store it in `_o19_` so you know who created it.
