# 🏘️ GetTogether Club Limits for TS4
This mod removes various club limits introduced in the Get Together expansion.

Because it's script-based, it won’t break with every TS4 update — so new releases are rarely needed.


## ⚙️ Configuration

After startup, the mod writes a configuration template to `The Sims 4/mod_data/gt_club_limits/clubs.ini.current.ini`.
To customize settings, copy this file to `clubs.ini` and edit it manually.  
There is **no PIE menu** for configuration.

## 🧩 PIE Menu Options
- Join an existing or new club (*see note)
- Delete existing clubs (*see note)
- Become the leader of a club
- Invite multiple Sims to a club (up to 100 per invitation — use with care)
- Start a club gathering  
  *(Note: Sims at work cannot join active gatherings)*
- Add 10,000 points to a club

**Note (*):**  
Due to UI limitations, the active Sim cannot delete their own clubs or join new ones.  
Click on another Sim to perform these actions.  
New clubs are always named `o19`.  
Switch to the club owner Sim to configure the club (name, description, rules, etc.).

## 🧑‍💻 Cheat Commands
These affect the **active Sim**:
* `GT_Club_Limits.help` - Print and log the following cheat commands:
* `o19.gtcl.join` - Join an existing club
* `o19.gtcl.delete` - Delete existing clubs (*1)
* `o19.gtcl.lead` - Become the leader of a club
* `o19.gtcl.invite` - Invite multiple sims to a club
* `o19.gtcl.start` - Start a club gathering
* `o19.gtcl.points` - Add 10,000 points to a club
* `o19.gtcl.print` - Write all club names and leaders to the log file

## 🔢 Club Limits
### Maximum Members per Club
By default, all limits are removed.
- `MAX_MEMBERS_UNLIMITED: True` — Removes member limits
- Set to `False` to enable limits and define `MAX_CLUB_MEMBERS`

Note: Sims in 3 clubs cannot create a new club, but can still join others or be added by household Sims.

### Maximum Clubs per Sim
The number of clubs a Sim can join can be limited.  
Depending on screen resolution, about 9 clubs can be displayed without a scroll bar.
- `MAX_CLUBS_UNLIMITED: True` — Removes club count limits
- Set to `False` to enable limits and define `MAX_CLUBS`

### Zones for Club Gatherings
- `NO_CLUB_ZONE_VALIDATION: True` — All zones accepted
- Set to `False` to restore default zone validation

### Club Requirements
- `NO_CLUB_REQUIREMENTS_VALIDATION: True` — Anyone can join any club  
  *(May allow non-human Sims to join)*
- Set to `False` to restore default requirements

# 📝 Addendum

## 🔄 Game compatibility
This mod has been tested with `The Sims 4` 1.119.109, S4CL 3.17, TS4Lib 0.3.42.
It is expected to remain compatible with future releases of TS4, S4CL, and TS4Lib.

## 📦 Dependencies
Download the ZIP file - not the source code.
Required components:
* [This Mod](../../releases/latest)
* [TS4-Library](https://github.com/Oops19/TS4-Library/releases/latest)
* [S4CL](https://github.com/ColonolNutty/Sims4CommunityLibrary/releases/latest)
* [The Sims 4](https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4)

If not already installed, download and install TS4 and the listed mods. All are available for free.

## 📥 Installation
* Locate the localized `The Sims 4` folder (it contains the `Mods` folder).
* Extract the ZIP file directly into this folder.

This will create:
* `Mods/_o19_/$mod_name.ts4script`
* `Mods/_o19_/$mod_name.package`
* `mod_data/$mod_name/*`
* `mod_documentation/$mod_name/*` (optional)
* `mod_sources/$mod_name/*` (optional)

Additional notes:
* CAS and Build/Buy UGC without scripts will create `Mods/o19/$mod_name.package`.
* A log file `mod_logs/$mod_name.txt` will be created once data is logged.
* You may safely delete `mod_documentation/` and `mod_sources/` folders if not needed.

### 📂 Manual Installation
If you prefer not to extract directly into `The Sims 4`, you can extract to a temporary location and copy files manually:
* Copy `mod_data/` contents to `The Sims 4/mod_data/` (usually required).
* `mod_documentation/` is for reference only — not required.
* `mod_sources/` is not needed to run the mod.
* `.ts4script` files can be placed in a folder inside `Mods/`, but storing them in `_o19_` is recommended for clarity.
* `.package` files can be placed in a anywhere inside `Mods/`.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
If installed correctly, no troubleshooting should be necessary.
For manual installs, verify the following:
* Does your localized `The Sims 4` folder exist? (e.g. localized to Die Sims 4, Les Sims 4, Los Sims 4, The Sims 4, ...)
  * Does it contain a `Mods/` folder?
    * Does Mods/_o19_/ contain:
      * `ts4lib.ts4script` and `ts4lib.package`?
      * `{mod_name}.ts4script` and/or `{mod_name}.package`
* Does `mod_data/` contain `{mod_name}/` with files?
* Does `mod_logs/` contain:
  * `Sims4CommunityLib_*_Messages.txt`?
  * `TS4-Library_*_Messages.txt`?
  * `{mod_name}_*_Messages.txt`?
* Are there any `last_exception.txt` or `last_exception*.txt` files in `The Sims 4`?


* When installed properly this is not necessary at all.
For manual installations check these things and make sure each question can be answered with 'yes'.
* Does 'The Sims 4' (localized to Die Sims 4, Les Sims 4, Los Sims 4, The Sims 4, ...) exist?
  * Does `The Sims 4` contain the folder `Mods`?
    * Does `Mods` contain the folder `_o19_`? 
      * Does `_19_` contain `ts4lib.ts4script` and `ts4lib.package` files?
      * Does `_19_` contain `{mod_name}.ts4script` and/or `{mod_name}.package` files?
  * Does `The Sims 4` contain the folder `mod_data`?
    * Does `mod_data` contain the folder `{mod_name}`?
      * Does `{mod_name}` contain files or folders?
  * Does `The Sims 4` contain the `mod_logs` ?
    * Does `mod_logs` contain the file `Sims4CommunityLib_*_Messages.txt`?
    * Does `mod_logs` contain the file `TS4-Library_*_Messages.txt`?
      * Is this the most recent version or can it be updated?
    * Does `mod_logs` contain the file `{mod_name}_*_Messages.txt`?
      * Is this the most recent version or can it be updated?
  * Doesn't `The Sims 4` contain the file(s) `last_exception.txt`  and/or `last_exception*.txt` ?
* Share the `The Sims 4/mod_logs/Sims4CommunityLib_*_Messages.txt` and `The Sims 4/mod_logs/{mod_name}_*_Messages.txt`  file.

If issues persist, share:
`mod_logs/Sims4CommunityLib_*_Messages.txt`
`mod_logs/{mod_name}_*_Messages.txt`
